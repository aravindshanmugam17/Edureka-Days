                                            MongoDB & Data Modeling
1.What is MongoDB? Explain MongoDB Terminologies.
MongoDB

 ~MongoDB is a schema-less database,
  which means the database can manage data without the need for a blueprint.

 ~Data in MongoDB is stored in documents with key-value pairs instead of rows and columns,
  which makes the data more flexible when compared to SQL databases.

MongoDB Terminologies.

 ~Database: In simple words, it can be called the physical container for data.

 ~Collection: A group of database documents can be called a collection

 ~Document: A set of key-value pairs can be designated as a document.

2.What are the facets of application that can be realizedby implementing proper and optimized datamodel?

The writer goes on to define the four criteria of a good data model: 

  (1) Data in a good model can be easily consumed.
  (2) Large data changes in a good model are scalable.
  (3) A good model provides predictable performance. 
  (4) A good model can adapt to changes in requirements,
      but not at the expense of 1-3.‚Äù

3.Install MongoDB on your localsystem?
